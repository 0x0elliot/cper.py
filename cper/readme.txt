Hey! Noob High schooler kid here. The rules are simple.
Just select the sign number of the emoticon that you wish to
choose and it would be copied to your clipboard. It is recommended to 
run it on your terminal/cmd because it looks way better and much more 
aesthetic.

I will keep updating this script every couple of days,
as I am pretty sure that I will be making use of this a lot.

What the auto installer does?

Nothing much really. Just pip installs pyperclip which is the module that
I used. If it doesn't workout for some reason then just go to your
terminal/cmd and type 'pip3 install pyperclip'

Also, Make sure that you have python 3.6 or above because that is what
I used.
